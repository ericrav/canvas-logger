# Canvas Logger
A utility to help collect ground truth data for the Digiwrite project.  Simply collects the coordinates of mouse or stylus movements and stores them on a Sparkfun phantom server.  Used [UIKit](http://getuikit.com/) as a front-end framework.

## Live
Canvas Logger is live and hosted on GitHub pages at:

## Triggers
Triggering other devices (to begin recording) is done by flipping a switch on a Firebase instance.  Implemention to come.
